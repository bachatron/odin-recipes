        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Growing up, chicken schnitzel was a classic. 
            I decided to make this dish oven-friendly using less oil, and an easier cleanup. 
            This dish tastes great with potato salad, or mashed potatoes and a nice crisp salad. 
            Tastes great the next day cold too! It's a family-favorite! 
            Enjoy with fresh squeezed lemon juice. </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil, or as desired</li>
            <li>6 chicken breasts, cut in half lengthwise (butterflied)</li>
            <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>Â¾ cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon paprika</li>
            <li>2 eggs, beaten</li>
            <li>2 cups seasoned bread crumbs</li>
            <li>1 large lemon, zested</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Procedure</h2>
        <ol>
            <h4>Step 1</h4>
            <li>Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a large baking sheet with aluminum foil and drizzle olive oil over foil. Place baking sheet in preheated oven.</li>
            <h4>Step 2</h4>
            <li>Flatten chicken breasts so they are all about 1/4-inch thick. Season chicken with salt and pepper.</li>
            <h4>Step 3</h4>
            <li>Mix flour and paprika together on a large plate. Beat eggs with salt and pepper in a shallow bowl. Mix bread crumbs and lemon zest together on a separate large plate. Dredge each chicken piece in flour mixture, then egg, and then bread crumbs mixture and set aside in 1 layer on a clean plate. Repeat with remaining chicken.</li>
            <h4>Step 4</h4>
            <li>Remove baking sheet from oven and arrange chicken in 1 layer on the sheet. Drizzle more olive oil over each piece of coated chicken.</li>
            <h4>Step 5</h4>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 5 to 6 minutes. Flip chicken and continue baking until no longer pink in the center and the breading is lightly browned, 5 to 6 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
